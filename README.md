# Disclaimer
This is not the best code in the world. This is just a tribute. The goal of this obviously to achieve greatness but on the way there will be experimentation lazyness and missteps. If you have a look at this code please bear this in mind.

## Legacy notes
This project previously used `pywebview` as a means of presenting the interface. It proved to be a cumbersome dependencies and has since been removed. The system now relies on a websocket server and a static webserver to present state and data in a standard browser.
